# Source-Final
This is a src for a WOW Legion Build that was apparrently used as a base line for many of the big name emu-servers that that is out there. I am unsure of the completeness and was given widely different backstories to how this became available.
I am unsure of the % of what is and isnt working. I am working mainly on a seperate build of my own with help from someone else with a completely different src.
This src is provided as a public service for anyone wanting to dive into the wow emu dev scene.
